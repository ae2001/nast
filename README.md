# News Article Summarizer and Translator (NAST)
 This Streamlit app allows users to summarize and translate news articles. The app is built using the Hugging Face transformers library for text summarization and the deep-translator library for translating non-English articles into English. It also automatically detects the language of the input article using the langdetect library.
